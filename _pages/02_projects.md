### A Pipeline for Data-Driven Learning of Topological Features with Applications to Protein Stability Prediction
<div class='video_imgs'>
    <a href="https://rdcu.be/eQBr7"><img src="/assets/img/cder_protein.gif" alt="protein topological features gif"></a>
</div>
* [Supplemental code for my paper](https://github.com/amish-mishra/CDER-protein-classifier/tree/main) on using CDER (Cover-Tree Differencing for Entropy Reduction) algorithm to identify highly informative regions of persistence diagrams to distinguish stable/unstable protein designs.
* [Published](https://rdcu.be/eQBr7)


### Machine Learning for sleep/wake stage classification

</div>

* Utilized [my personally written algorithm for Topological Data Analysis (TDA)](https://github.com/amish-mishra/ML_Del-Rips_sleep_wake_classification) for a data analysis project that involved classifying patient sleep stage based on their heart rate. 
* [Publication in _Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics_](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/applied-mathematics-and-statistics/articles/10.3389/fams.2023.1179301/full)

    <a href="https://github.com/amish-mishra/cechmate_DR"><img src="/assets/img/dr_filtration.png" alt="delaunay-rips filtration comparison"></a>
</div>
* [A computationally efficient filtration for TDA](https://github.com/amish-mishra/cechmate_DR). Personally written algorithm that I used for a [machine learning project](https://github.com/amish-mishra/ML_Del-Rips_sleep_wake_classification) for an upcoming paper.  

### Solar Eclipse Data Analysis
* Co-led an 8-week internship program with 3 student interns, producing a 30-page comprehensive data analysis report on atmospheric changes during a solar eclipse.
* [Produced repository of student code](https://github.com/HannahPefley/Solar-Eclipse-Data-Analysis) written by a team of 3 students during summer 2024 internship (R and python)

### Matrix-Chain Multiplication Problem
* Solved and analyzed using a Brute-force approach and a Dynamic programming approach. 
* [Code and report available](https://github.com/amish-mishra/matrix-chain-multiplication)
