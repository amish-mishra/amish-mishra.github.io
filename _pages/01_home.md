## Projects (on [Github](https://github.com/amish-mishra))

[Machine Learning for sleep/wake stage classification](https://github.com/amish-mishra/ML_Del-Rips_sleep_wake_classification)
* Utilized my personally written algorithm for Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for a data analysis project that involved classifying patient sleep stage based on their heart rate.  

[Matrix-Chain Multiplication Problem](https://github.com/amish-mishra/matrix-chain-multiplication)
* Solved and analyzed using a Brute-force approach and a Dynamic programming approach.  

[The Delaunay-Rips Filtration](https://github.com/amish-mishra/cechmate_DR)
* A computationally efficient filtration for TDA. Personally written algorithm that I used for a [machine learning project](https://github.com/amish-mishra/ML_Del-Rips_sleep_wake_classification) for an upcoming paper.
