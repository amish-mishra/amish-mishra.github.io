Hello, friends. Welcome to my website! Feel free to click on the links and the other tabs to see some of my work and background.

### 2022 Ignite Off! National Competition 
I was awarded 1st place for my 5 minute presentation on my internship work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Here is a related article written about the competition: [First all-ORISE Ignite Off Competition names ORNL intern as its winner](https://orise.orau.gov/news/archive/2022/first-all-orise-ignite-off-competition-names-ornl-intern-as-its-winner.html)

### Projects (on [Github](https://github.com/amish-mishra))

[Machine Learning for sleep/wake stage classification](https://github.com/amish-mishra/ML_Del-Rips_sleep_wake_classification)
>Utilized my personally written algorithm for Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for a data analysis project that involved classifying patient sleep stage based on their heart rate.
[Matrix-Chain Multiplication Problem](https://github.com/amish-mishra/matrix-chain-multiplication)
>Solved and analyzed using a Brute-force approach and a Dynamic programming approach.
[The Delaunay-Rips Filtration](https://github.com/amish-mishra/cechmate_DR)
> A computationally efficient filtration for TDA. Personally written algorithm that I used for a [machine learning project](https://github.com/amish-mishra/ML_Del-Rips_sleep_wake_classification) for an upcoming paper.
[Interactive plot of solution to 1-D heat equation](https://github.com/amish-mishra/1d-heat-eqn)
