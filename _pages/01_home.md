### Topological Data Analysis and Statistics for Modern Biological Discovery

Amish Mishra, Ph.D., is a mathematician and data scientist specializing in topological data analysis (TDA) and statistical modeling for computational biology. He serves as a tenure-track [assistant professor of mathematics at Taylor University](https://www.taylor.edu/employees/amish-mishra), where he has helped expand the university's data science program since 2024.

Dr. Mishra's research sits at the intersection of abstract mathematics and real-world biological insight. His work applies TDA, machine learning, and rigorous statistical methods to high-dimensional biological datasets, including protein structure analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, and gene interaction networks. He also performs contract bioinformatics work in industry, where he develops mathematically grounded frameworks for uncovering structure, uncertainty, and mechanistic patterns in complex multi-omics data.

As an educator, Dr. Mishra is committed to training the next generation of data-savvy scientists. He teaches courses in data science, statistics, and discrete mathematics with an emphasis on inclusive pedagogy, real datasets, and mathematically principled modeling. He mentors undergraduate research teams working on computational biology, atmospheric science, and applied machine learning.

His work reflects a belief that mathematics and data, practiced with clarity, rigor, and integrity, can advance both scientific discovery and human understanding.
