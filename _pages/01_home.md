Hello, friends. Welcome to my website!

Check out this 3 minute video I made giving an overview of my research:

* [Seeing Data: For Now We see Dimly, but Soon We Will See Shape to Shape](https://youtu.be/IsaGI1OBNhE)

Here is the 2022 Ignite Off! National competition that I took 1st place in for my 5 minute presentation. You will find me at the 19 minute mark:
* [Shaping Data with Quantum Computers](https://vimeo.com/743411827/819eacfe78)


My projects are available on [Github](https://github.com/amish-mishra). They include:

- [Matrix-Chain Multiplication Problem](https://github.com/amish-mishra/matrix-chain-multiplication): solved and analyzed using a Brute-force approach and a Dynamic programming approach
- [The Delaunay-Rips Filtration](https://github.com/amish-mishra/cechmate_DR): A computationally efficient filtration for TDA
- [Interactive plot of solution to 1-D heat equation](https://github.com/amish-mishra/1d-heat-eqn)
